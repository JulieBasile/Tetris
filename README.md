Tetris is a puzzle game that uses shapes called Tetriminoes, played on a grid called the Matrix. 


 OBJECTIVE 
 - To make the Tetomino shapes fit together. 
 
 HOW TO PLAY
- Tetromino shapes will drop one by one from the top of the Matrix and lower to the bottom. 
- Tetrominos come in 5 letter of the alphabet shapes (l, z, t, o, i)
- Make the Tetriminoes land in such a way they form solid horizontal lines. The lines formed will then disappear from the Matrix.


Okay Panos, lets be real, there is still a bunch of items to complete :) Working on the below. Please let me know if you have anything to add to the list! 

TO DO 
- Move down with arrow key to accelerate shapes
- Rotate does not work
- Start / stop bottom lacks functionality 
- Score needs to calculate
- Game needs to stop or lets just refresh forever
- Need to change green color shape, lake of contrast to the background shade
- CSS is calling and asking why I did not use more of it
